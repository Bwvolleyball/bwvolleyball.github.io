> My GitHub Pages website - powered by Angular!

Hello! You've (probably) stumbled across the repository for my GitHub Pages website, but you won't find
any source code here! The source code for this project lives in [this repository](https://github.com/Bwvolleyball/bwvolleyball-github-io-src).

This GitHub repository only receives the pre-built Angular website, via a [GitHub Actions job](https://github.com/Bwvolleyball/bwvolleyball-github-io-src/blob/master/.github/workflows/push-to-gh-pages.yml),
through which it is deployed to this website via the [angular-cli-ghpages tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-cli-ghpages).

If you would also like an Angualar website as your GitHub Pages website, 
check out [this blog post](https://medium.com/@brandon.ward1993/angular-for-github-pages-35be855a4b0?source=friends_link&sk=835ad2a4cb6cf032d71403f966f6504e) that details how you might achieve it!

Other than that, thanks for visiting, and be sure to check out the real website @ https://bwvolleyball.github.io.
