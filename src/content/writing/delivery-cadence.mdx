title: "Ship Faster Without Breaking Teams"
summary: "CI/CD guardrails, rollout choreography, and the habits that moved releases from quarterly to weekly."

Moving a team from quarterly drops to weekly releases is about predictability, not heroics. Tighten promotion gates, keep environments boring, and measure leading indicators like time-to-rollback and mean build health—not just deployment counts.

- Keep artifacts immutable and promotion-driven.
- Build preflight checks that are fast and noisy when they fail.
- Invest in observability _before_ dialing up cadence so incidents get smaller, not louder.

Most wins came from deleting steps, not adding new ones. Smaller batches, cleaner feedback, calmer teams.
