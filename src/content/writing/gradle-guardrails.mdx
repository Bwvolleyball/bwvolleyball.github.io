Custom Gradle plugins pay off when they eliminate copy/paste build logic and surface opinionated defaults. The most useful patterns were:

- Centralized dependency versions with type-safe accessors.
- Build scans wired into CI for visibility and trend spotting.
- Linting + test suites parallelized by default, with flaky detectors promoted to red.

Treat build tooling like a product: roadmap it, test it, and keep the UX sharp for every contributor.
